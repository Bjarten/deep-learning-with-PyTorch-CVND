# deep-learning-with-PyTorch-CVND
This repository was created as part of a lesson from the [Computer Vision Nanodegree at Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891).

## Lessons

This folder contains the [Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://github.com/udacity/DL_PyTorch) lessons from [Udacity](https://Udacity.com).

The problems in the lessons have been solved by me to practice the use of PyTorch for Deep Learning.
